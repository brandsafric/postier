# Postier
Postier is a powerful automation tool built on top of Laravel framework that allows businesses, organizations and individuals to automate their workflows by integrating various web applications and services together. With Postier, users can easily create custom workflows, or "Flows" as they are called, by connecting different applications such as Gmail, Slack, Trello, Asana, and many more, and automate repetitive tasks.

We designed Postier to be user-friendly. Our goal is to create software that is easy for even non-technical users to create Flows without writing any code. It allows users to trigger actions based on certain events or conditions and control the flow of data between the connected applications. Our advanced features such as conditional logic, data mapping etc, gives users complete control over their workflows.
Additionally, Postier can provide a wide range of pre-built integrations that users helps to speed up their automation processes. Postier supports over 2,000 web applications that allows for complex workflows and advanced use cases, making Postier a versatile tool for automation.
